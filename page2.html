    <h1>Cookie Click Bait üç™(Favorite app project of this year)</h1>

    <div class="containerflex">
        <div class="column">
            <p>Cookie ClickBait is a P5.js project based on the concept of cookie clicker with a twist. While a seemingly simple game, this project was conceived in an attempt to create a P5.js game from scratch, which was my intent with the help of my classmate Chris Garcia. Over all the game itself is simple: there are three cookies descending in a loop across the screen, your goal is to click them and accrue enough points to reach 70+ to win. The difficulty is not without some reward as each cookie goes across the screen at differing rates, but increases or decreases the score depending on what you go for. Albeit a simple project, Cookie Clickbait is one of my favorite and most unique projects from this year and am happy to share it.</p>
