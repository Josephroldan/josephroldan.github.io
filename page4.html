            <p class="lyfe">On another note, one of my most favorite activities is a form of contemplation or existential thinking. Although a strange activity in this day and age, more often than not, people of my era don't often find the time to sit back and reflect on both what's happened throughout their day and/or how to correct/improve their reactions next time such circumstances happen. While I have been credited as just having an old soul, it does not detract from the fact that its important to be able to talk out and reflect and improve, as many of the philosophical thinkers of the past are some of the most prime examples of this as many used their time reflecting rather than checking their social media and reading the news every instance of free time they've been alloted. Coupled by their extensive life experience, helped shape them and those influenced by their teachings, showing some inherent values in such activities. Although not nearly as important, other activities of mine include sports like volleyball and soccer to keep in shape and have a bit of enjoyment out of my physical activities, or reading.</p>
