            <p> Hi, my name is Joseph Emmanuel Roldan. i'm currently a senior at Pasadena High School. For the past four years, I've worked in the APP Academy pathway, creating websites and games to develop my my skills as a programmer. Other hobbies of mine include reading, contemplating, and sports such as Basketball, and Ultimate Frisbee. Some of my favorite classes include P.E., AP Govt, and piano to name a few as I particularly love learning about the world arround me and my surrounding to understand how to better it in the future as well as learning and practicing the art of music(although drums are my favorite instrument), all the while keeping inshape with physical fitness instruction. Overall, Throughout my time in the app academy, I've sought to understand both the career pathway of a computer programmer as well as what it means to have fun in other aspects of my life and am elated to share the sum of my experiences of this year in my work through my work.</p>
